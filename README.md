# Halloween

This is a collection of scripts used in my Halloween projects.

# RP2040 PIR Relay Actuator
This script monitors a PIR and activates a Relay when motion is detected.
It can be used to activate a shop bought halloween decoration/prop that
has a momentary action button. Although it works on an RP2040 Zero it could
be used on a Pi Pico but you may need to update the GPIO references.

# RP2040 Skull Eyes
This script provides two neopixel 'eyes' for a Halloween skull. A button can
be used to switch colour modes.
